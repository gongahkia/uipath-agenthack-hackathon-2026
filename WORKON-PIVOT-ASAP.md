# WORKON-PIVOT-ASAP

Strategy doc for `haus`. Locked direction after market research + user discussion 2026-05-16.

## North star

> Show HN: I gave Claude an MCP server and made it interior-design my HDB flat.

- *Goal*: GitHub stars + HN front page. Not revenue. Not SaaS.
- *Niche*: HDB BTO Singapore. Stays specific. Specificity is the hook, not the liability.
- *Wedge*: MCP / AI-agent autonomy. The 30-tool surface area is the moat.
- *Demo*: one-shot "design my flat" agent. User picks BTO layout + style prompt → Claude autonomously furnishes it end-to-end.

## KPIs (90 days post-launch)

- [Speculation] Realistic target: 1.5k–3k stars, HN front page once, ~30k repo visits.
- Stretch: 5k+ stars, sustained MCP-directory traffic.
- Floor: 300–500 stars without HN traction.

## Tension acknowledged

Singapore-only + global HN audience is a trade-off. Specificity wins on HN *only if* the demo carries. Mitigation: demo quality is the single biggest lever — if the GIF doesn't make people screenshot-share it, none of the rest matters.

## Competitive landscape (verified)

- *Direct SG*: Qanvast BTO Layout Planner, 3dbto.sg, btomyhome.com. All free + lead-gen or paid SketchUp models. None ship MCP.
- *Adjacent AI*: Maket.ai (1M users, $4.4M raised), CubiCasa (acquired Clear Capital 2021), Planner 5D, Snaptrude. None target SG, none ship MCP.
- *MCP for Three.js*: locchung/three-js-mcp, baryhuang/mcp-threejs, DmitriyGolub/threejs-devtools-mcp. All general-purpose scene tools, none vertical for room design.
- *OSS room editors*: OpenPlan3D, theLodgeBots/open3dFloorplan, mehanix/arcada. Crowded but none ride MCP.

[Inference] White space = vertical (BTO) + MCP-native. Both edges are needed; either alone has competitors.

## Tier 1 — demo-determinant (ship or it fails)

### 1. Hero demo GIF/video
- 30-second loop at top of README. Below the badges, above everything else.
- Content: user types `"design a minimalist 4-room family flat"` → Claude calls ~15 tools → fully furnished apartment rotates in view.
- Record at 1080p, ≤8MB GIF or mp4 link.
- *Files*: `asset/demo/hero.mp4`, `asset/demo/hero.gif`, README.md hero section.

### 2. Higher-level agent loop tool
- Current MCP exposes CRUD primitives only. Demos read as "Claude calls a function" not "Claude designs."
- Add `design_room` / `design_flat` tools that bundle multi-step intent:
  - Input: room_id (or whole flat) + style prompt + constraints.
  - Internally: read layout → choose furniture set → place → align → snap → tag.
  - Returns: summary + tool-call trace for transparency.
- *Files*: `src/haus/mcp_server.py` (new high-level tools), `src/haus/agent_loop.py` (new).

### 3. BTO layouts dropdown (pre-seeded)
- The `corpus/` already has cleaned BTO floor plans. Surface them as a one-click "Load real layout" picker in the editor.
- Bundle the vectorized outputs as JSON so no preprocessing on first run.
- *Files*: `viewer/js/btoLibrary.js` (new), `viewer/editor.html` (dropdown), `corpus/library/*.json` (pre-vectorized).

### 4. README hero rewrite
- Open with: 1-line value prop, hero GIF, 1-command install, "Try the demo" link.
- Move stack table, MCP tool table, credits, architecture below the fold.
- Keep current attribution intact per user decision; just relocate to bottom.
- *Files*: `README.md`.

### 5. One-command install
- `uvx haus` or `pipx install haus` → `haus view` opens browser + MCP-ready.
- Currently requires `git clone && make setup && make view`. Friction kills star conversion.
- *Files*: `pyproject.toml`, `src/haus/cli.py`.

## Tier 2 — virality multipliers

### 6. Provider showdown content
- Same prompt across Claude / GPT / Gemini. Side-by-side furnished outputs as a still image or short video.
- Lives in a `BENCHMARKS.md` or blog post. Drives reshares; legitimate evaluation, not just bait.
- *Files*: `BENCHMARKS.md`, `asset/benchmarks/*.png`.

### 7. MCP directory listings
- mcp.so, mcp.pizza, pulsemcp.com, smithery.ai, Anthropic MCP directory.
- Each takes <30min, free distribution, surfaces in `claude mcp add` flows.
- *Files*: `mcp-manifest.json` if any registry needs it.

### 8. Editor visual polish
- First-impression matters more than feature count. Pass on lighting, materials, shadow softness, default camera angle, ambient occlusion.
- Default scene must look good in screenshots without any user setup.
- *Files*: `viewer/js/scene.js` (lighting), `viewer/js/main.js` (default camera).

### 9. SG tech amplification
- Pre-launch ping to Zane (@injaneity), Wei Sin (@weisintai). Post on SG-focused Twitter / r/singapore the day of HN submission.
- HN traction window is ~4 hours. Geographic time-zone: submit ~8am PT (11pm SGT) for max US daytime + SG evening engagement.

## Tier 3 — explicitly cut

- *Generic raster→vector pipeline pitch*: CubiCasa5k ML beats CV on accuracy. Don't headline this. Keep code, demote in narrative.
- *Photo-to-stage / real estate agent pivot*: out of scope per user decision.
- *Multi-floor / BIM export / DXF*: distraction. BTOs are single-floor.
- *Mobile / AR scan*: Apple RoomPlan / CubiCasa own that. Not our wedge.
- *Generative text-to-floorplan*: Maket/SpatialGen territory. Stays out.
- *B2B sales to designers/contractors*: not the goal.

## Launch checklist

- [ ] Hero GIF recorded + embedded in README
- [ ] `design_room` + `design_flat` tools implemented and stable
- [ ] Pre-vectorized BTO library shipped in repo
- [ ] README rewritten with value prop above the fold
- [ ] One-command install verified on clean macOS + Linux
- [ ] Editor lighting/materials polish pass complete
- [ ] BENCHMARKS.md with provider showdown
- [ ] Listed on mcp.so + mcp.pizza + pulsemcp + smithery + Anthropic registry
- [ ] HN draft title + first comment prewritten
- [ ] SG tech amplification network primed

## Risks & mitigations

- *MCP novelty saturates*: window closing fast. Ship in weeks not months. // user said "whatever it takes" but real-world urgency stands
- *Singapore-niche caps reach*: mitigation is demo quality + framing the SG-ness as charm. If first 100 HN comments are "what's HDB?" we lost — pre-empt with a one-line glossary in README.
- *Three.js editor polish bar is high*: budget real time for materials/lighting. Bad lighting = "looks like a school project" comments.
- *Codex Hackathon credit stays*: per user. [Inference] Some HN readers will read "later dropped by original team" as a negative signal. Counter-narrative ready: rebuilt solo, MCP layer is original work, link to current commit graph.

## Concrete next actions (this week)

1. Implement `design_room` / `design_flat` MCP tools (Tier 1, item 2).
2. Pre-vectorize 4–6 real BTO units into JSON; build dropdown (Tier 1, item 3).
3. Lighting/material polish pass on the editor (Tier 2, item 8).
4. Record hero demo once items 1–3 land (Tier 1, item 1).
5. Rewrite README hero (Tier 1, item 4).
6. Wire `uvx haus` install path (Tier 1, item 5).
7. Then directories + benchmarks + launch.

## Honest expectations

[Inference] Top-quartile outcome with full execution: 3–5k stars, one HN front-page day, sustained MCP-directory traffic, no revenue. Floor-plan editors don't compound like devtools or AI frameworks — there's no Cursor trajectory here, and chasing one would force out of the SG niche. Calibrate accordingly.
